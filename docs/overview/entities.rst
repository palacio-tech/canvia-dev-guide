Key Entities
==================

Artworks
----------

A work of art, artwork, art piece, piece of art or art object is an aesthetic physicalâ€…item or artistic creation.
Canvia maintains digital renditions of these artworks in 
its repository. The digital renditions may be in the form
of images or videos.

We currently support following file formats for artworks:
JPEG, PNG, TIFF, MP4. Canvia devices don't support any
audio playback for now.

An artwork entity stored in our database consists of

* The high quality image or video rendition of the artwork.
* Its thumbnails for representation purposes in web or mobile
  user interfaces.
* Metadata associated with the artwork (title, artist, description,
  categorizations, etc.)
* Ownership information

There are two types of artworks

* Canvia artworks are prepared by Canvia curation team
  and made available on the platform for all customers.
  Some of these artworks are free for all and some are 
  available under various premium subscriptions.
* Personal artworks are uploaded by users and they are
  accessible only to the user who owns them.

Personal artworks are also called my artworks in
this guide. Users may just upload their personal 
images as personal artworks. They don't need to
provide detailed meta data information. However,
should the users choose to do so, they can categorize
and annotate their images just like regular artworks
in Canvia.

Artworks are categorized by Canvia curation team 
under following heads:

* Subject : Landscape, Figurative, Architecture, etc.
